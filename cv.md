I am a software developer with a keen interest in crafting meaningful web based applications.

Pushing the envelope, getting dirty with code, understanding clients, providing solutions that are user focused and championing cutting edge design are my passions.

I've had the opportunity to work across some interesting areas with a diverse group of people, allowing me to grow my skills in areas such as:

- Agile development
- Verbal and written communication
- Teamwork
- Mentoring
- User centered design and UX
- Stakeholder engagement
- Responsive design
- API development
- Programming, programming, programming and programming

I am constantly looking to grow, professionally and personally, so when i'm not crunching 1's and 0's you can find me exploring the world, capturing sounds as [The Atlas Room](http://soundcloud.com/theatlasroom), documenting my adventures [through the viewfinder](https://instagram.com/theatlasroom) or doing my best to copy [Andres Iniesta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86MpZTqoWZk) on the soccer field.
